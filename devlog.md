documenting my video game creation process!

28/06/2025 -> finished planning stage, created a new unity universal 2d project to use for _Thresholds_!

I was inspired by authors like Dan Brown who explore systems of power and truth. I want to replicate that moral struggle in a game format — where players aren’t just told what to think, but have to uncover and interpret the truth themselves, when tossed into a world where these systems take center stage. I am choosing to make the interaction simple so the story can be profound and encourage the player to reflect on the morality of every decision they make in the game. Using Artificial Intelligence for the chat feature should make the interaction more natural and also give the users freedom to express their own thoughts and beliefs to move the story forward. In exploring these relevant features, I've come across research like Justine Cassell’s in AI agents that develop social intelligence and converse like humans, and Pattie Maes's research in fusing AI with human physiology. Their ideas inspired my plan about narrative mechanics, as well as the implementation and ethics of player-driven, AI-powered features in video games. Looking forward to working on _Thresholds_!
